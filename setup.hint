ldesc: "CRM114 is a system to examine incoming e-mail, system log 
streams, data files or other data streams, and to sort, filter, or 
alter the incoming files or data streams according to the user's 
wildest desires. Criteria for categorization of data can be by 
satisfaction of regexes, by sparse binary polynomial matching with a 
Bayesian Chain Rule evaluator, or by other means."
